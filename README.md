# üß¨ Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning and MLOps

This project aims to detect skin cancer from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on **DenseNet201**. It integrates a full-stack web application (Django frontend & backend), a CI/CD pipeline, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, and monitoring/logging with the ELK stack. It also utilizes **DAGsHub** and **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model management.

## üöÄ Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Skin cancer classifier built using CNN with **DenseNet201**.
- **Web Application**:
  - Django-based frontend and backend.
  - Secure login and image upload functionality.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Automated steps to build, test, and deploy the application locally.
- **Containerization & Orchestration**:
  - Docker used for containerizing the app.
  - Kubernetes used for orchestrating multiple services.
- **Monitoring & Logging**:
  - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for real-time monitoring and log analysis.
- **MLOps Tools**:
  - **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model lifecycle management.
  - **DAGsHub** for data versioning and collaboration.
